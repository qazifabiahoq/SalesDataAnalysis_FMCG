# Retail Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview:

The project utilizes a real-world dataset from the FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) retail industry, containing detailed sales records of customer purchases. The dataset includes information on orders, products, store locations, and customer demographics, enabling comprehensive analysis of sales trends, store performance, product profitability, and customer behavior.

### Retail Sales Analysis:

The retail sales analysis delves into the distribution of sales by category, sales trends over time, top-performing stores, and the effectiveness of discounts in driving sales. It also explores the profitability of top and bottom-selling products, sales variation across regions, and average sales per product category. KPI analysis includes product sales growth rate, category market share, profit margin per product, customer reach index, and customer acquisition cost.

### Product Analysis:

The product analysis focuses on identifying top-selling products by revenue, overall sales and monthly sales trends in 2023, and category performance by states in sales. It also examines overall profit, profit by product and category, sales by population and categories, and profit for the top 20 products. KPI analysis includes product performance index, product revenue concentration, product sales velocity, and product return rate.

### Geographical Analysis:

The geographical analysis explores overall and yearly sales and profit trends, sales and profit variation across different regions, and detailed sales and profit analysis by state in the south region. It also identifies the top 10 cities by sales in Karnataka, the top 5 categories and subcategories in the south region, and sales and profit by product in the south region. KPI analysis includes sales performance by state, city sales contribution, population group sales performance, discount impact on sales by region, average sales per transaction by region, product category popularity by region, profit margin by region, and sales growth rate by population group.
